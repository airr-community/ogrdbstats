Thank you for your feedback. I have:
- Proof-read the description text and made some changes
- added a reference describing the methods to the description text
- Replaced the use of T and F with TRUE and FALSE throught the package
- Added examples to all exported functions
- Replaced print()/cat() with use message()/warning()  
- Removed all code that changed the user's current directory

Best wishes
