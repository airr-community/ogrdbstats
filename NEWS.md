# ogrdbstats 0.5.2

* The Vignette now resolves correctly with current versions of knitr.

# ogrdbstats 0.5.1

* Added support for recent versions of IgDiscover, which now uses AIRR format for filtered.tsv.
* The AIRR format sequence column may now be supplied ungapped, in which case ogrdbstats will gap the sequences before use.
* Output files will be named correctly even if the input file includes more than one period in its name.

# ogrdbstats 0.5.0

* This is the first packaged version available from CRAN, and also available as a Docker image. The documentation has been reworked, and R help has been added for externally callable functions.
