Description: Multiple tools are now available for inferring the personalised 
    germ line set from an adaptive immune receptor repertoire. 
    Output from these tools is converted to 
    a single format and supplemented with rich data such as usage and 
    characterisation of 'novel' germline alleles. This data can be 
    particularly useful when considering the validity of novel inferences. Use
    of the alaysis provided is described in <doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00435>.
