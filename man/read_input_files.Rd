\usage{
read_input_files(ref_filename, inferred_filename, species, filename, chain,
  hap_gene, segment, chain_type)
}
\arguments{
\item{ref_filename}{Name of file containing IMGT-aligned reference genes in FASTA format}

\item{inferred_filename}{Name of file containing sequences of inferred novel alleles, or '-' if none}

\item{species}{Species name used in field 3 of the IMGT germline header with spaces omitted, if the reference file is from IMGT. Otherwise ''}

\item{filename}{Name of file containing annotated reads in AIRR, CHANGEO or IgDiscover format. The format is detected automatically}

\item{chain}{one of VH, VK, VL, D, JH, JK, JL}

\item{hap_gene}{The haplotyping columns will be completed based on the usage of the two most frequent alleles of this gene. If NA, the column will be blank}

\item{segment}{one of V, D, J}

\item{chain_type}{one of H, L}
}
\value{
A named list containing the following elements:
\tabular{ll}{
ref_genes  \tab named list of IMGT-gapped reference genes \cr
inferred_seqs \tab named list of IMGT-gapped inferred (novel) sequences. \cr
input_sequences \tab data frame with one row per annotated read, with CHANGEO-style column names
                          One key point: the column SEQ_CALL is the gene call for the segment under analysis. Hence if segment is 'V',
                          'V_CALL' will be renamed 'SEG_CALL' whereas is segment is 'J', 'J_CALL' is renamed 'SEG_CALL'. This simplifies
                          downstream processing.
                          Rows in the input file with ambiguous SEG_CALLs, or no call, are removed. \cr
genotype_db \tab named list of gene sequences referenced in the annotated reads (both reference and novel sequences) \cr
haplo_details \tab data used for haplotype analysis, showing allelic ratios calculated with various potential haplotyping genes \cr
genotype \tab data frame containing information provided in the OGRDB genotype csv file \cr
calculated_NC \tab a boolean that is TRUE if mutation counts were calculated by this library, FALSE if they were read from the annotated read file \cr
